# altera-sockit-zephyr
zephyr rtos custom board and soc for the Terasic SocKit board.

This is a out-of-tree (i.e. custom) sample for the Terasic SocKit board. The "hello_world" sample is an almost exact copy of the sample at https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr.

Please Note: actually I am at the begin of the learning curve of zephyr rtos development. This code published here is probably not working (and may never work). I plublished it for reference only.
